Unity AR Test Project
This repository contains a Unity project that I developed as a part of a technical test during a job interview. The project is focused on Augmented Reality (AR) using Unity 2021.X, Vuforia, and ARFoundation.

Features
AR Foundations: The project leverages the capabilities of ARFoundation for cross-platform AR development.
Vuforia Integration: Vuforia is integrated for advanced image and object tracking.
Remote Testing Environment: A setup for remote testing environments is included. This allows testing various tracking scenarios directly in the Unity editor.
iOS Deployment: The project supports deployment to iPhones. You can compile and build it using Xcode.
